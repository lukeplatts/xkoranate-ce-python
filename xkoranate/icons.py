"""Icon loader. Replaces the Qt resource file icons.qrc: icon("document-new").

Toolbar/action glyphs are served from the Material Design Icons font via
qtawesome, so the whole app gets a modern, theme-consistent icon set from the
single set of call sites that already use icon(<key>). Brand/raster images that
are not glyphs (the application icon) fall back to the bundled PNGs.

Glyphs are tinted with theme.ink(), which differs between light and dark mode.
QIcon objects don't repaint themselves when that changes, so actions created
via icon_action() are tracked in a small registry and re-issued a fresh icon
by refresh_icons(), which runs whenever theme.signal.changed fires.
