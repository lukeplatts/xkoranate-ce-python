"""Central place for the application's visual theme.

A flat, modern theme is applied via PyQtDarkTheme (qdarktheme), in one of
three modes — light, dark, or true dark (an OLED-friendly, pure-black variant
of dark) — with a single fixed accent colour running through all of them.
Other modules (icons.py, ui/typography.py, eventeditor.py's wizard
breadcrumb) read ACCENT / ink() / muted() from here rather than hardcoding
colours, and listen on `signal.changed` so everything re-tints together when
the mode is switched at runtime.
