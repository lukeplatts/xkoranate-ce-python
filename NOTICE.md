## Third-party components (current Python port)

- **PySide6** (Qt for Python), © The Qt Company, licensed under the LGPLv3.
  Used as an unmodified dependency, not vendored — see
  <https://www.qt.io/licensing/> and the LGPLv3 text at
  <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html>.
- **QtAwesome**, used for in-app icons, bundles the Material Design Icons,
  Remix Icon, Elusive Icons, and Codicons font sets under their respective
  licenses (SIL OFL / MIT / CC). Used as an unmodified dependency, not
  vendored — see <https://github.com/spyder-ide/qtawesome>.

(The original C++ program bundled portions of Qt 4.7.3 and the KDE Oxygen
icon theme directly; the Python port instead depends on PySide6 and
QtAwesome as ordinary packages, so their license texts are not reproduced
here.)
