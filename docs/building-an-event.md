# Building an event

Click **New event** in the sidebar to start the 5-step wizard: **Sport →
Signups → Competition → Groups → Scorinate**. A breadcrumb across the top of
the window tracks which step you're on, and **Back**/**Next** move between
them.

## 1. Sport

Pick a sport from the tree on the left. Sports are organized by discipline
(athletics, football codes, racket sports, and so on) — expand a category to
see the individual events inside it.

Under the hood, each sport is wired to a scoring engine (a "paradigm") that
determines how results come out: some produce head-to-head match scores,
others produce race times or placements. You don't need to know which engine
a sport uses — picking the sport is enough, and the rest of the wizard adapts
to it automatically.

Some sports show extra options below the sport tree once selected — for
example, several football-code sports let you turn on **home advantage** and
set its magnitude. These options are sport-specific and only appear when
relevant.

## 2. Signups

Add the athletes or teams competing. You can:

- Add participants one at a time with **Add participant**.
- Import a roster in one go with **Import from text file** — a semicolon-delimited
  `.txt` file, one participant per line: `name;nation;skill` (extra columns
  are supported for sport-specific attributes like style mods).

Use the min/max skill filters to narrow which imported participants are
eligible, if your source file has a wider range than you want to use.

## 3. Competition

Choose the competition format from the dropdown. Available formats depend on
the sport's paradigm, and include:

- **Mass start** — everyone races at once; results are times or placements.
- **Round robin** — every participant/team plays every other one.
- **Individual matches** — a fixed set of head-to-head matchups.
- **Multiple-run competition** — best-of-N attempts (e.g. gymnastics, diving).
- **Shooting competition** / **Archery ranking round** — precision-sport
  scoring formats.

Some formats show an options widget here too (number of matchdays,
tiebreaker rules, and similar).

## 4. Groups

Organize participants into groups, brackets, or seeding pools, if the
competition format needs them. The toolbar lets you create a group, add one
or all participants to it, delete a group, and randomize group assignment.
Drag and drop to reorder within the tree.

Click **View full schedule** to preview the fixture list for competition
formats that have a fixed schedule (round robin, individual matches). Formats
without a fixed schedule (like mass start) will tell you there's nothing to
preview.

## 5. Scorinate

This is where you actually run the simulation:

- **Scorinate event** generates results for the current matchday/round.
  You'll be warned before overwriting results you've already generated.
- **View match odds** shows fixture-by-fixture win probabilities based on
  participant skill (available for competition formats that support it).
- Use the matchday dropdown to switch between rounds once you have more
  than one.
- **Export to file** saves the results as a `.txt` file, ready to post.

Check **BBCode output ([pre] tags, bold winners)** before exporting or
copying if you're posting straight to the forum — it wraps the results in
`[pre]` tags and automatically bolds each match's winner.
